# Pizza-Queue
This project uses heaps to manage incoming pizza orders and creates an order queue for the pizzas.
It ensures that pizzas are prepared in a way that those with earlier time stamps are prepared first.
Users can customize their pizzas by adding certain toppings, sizes, prices, etc. This was created for
my Intermediate Python class in Spring 2023.
